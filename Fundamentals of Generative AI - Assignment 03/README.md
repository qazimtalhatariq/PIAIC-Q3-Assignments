# Fundamentals of Generative AI Assignment-03

**What are Compound AI Systems?**

Compound AI systems are systems that can handle AI tasks by combining multiple interacting components.AS the name indicates Compound AI Systems can handle many tasks at the same time and they enhance performance. These components can include multiple calls to models, retrievers or external tools. Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) applications, for example, are compound AI systems, as they combine (at least) a model and a data retrieval system. Compound AI systems leverage the strengths of various AI models, tools and pipelines to enhance performance, versatility and re-usability compared to solely using individual models.

**What are AI Agents?**

AI Agents are used for the the task handling. AI Agents can react via different tools. AI agents can work on the behalf of Humans. They csn be used for the specific tasks.They are specialized for Specific Tasks Handling.

**What is the relation between Compound AI Systems and AI Agents?**

An **AI Agent** can be a component within a Compound AI System, where multiple agents might interact or collaborate to handle different aspects of a larger task. The Compound AI System brings these agents and other AI tools together to create a more powerful and flexible solution.

**What is the difference between Fine Tuning and RAG?**

**Fine Tuning** is a process of adjusting the model parameters to improve its performance on a specific task. **RAG** is a process of combining multiple models to enhance performance. **Fine Tuning** is a process of adjusting the model parameters to improve its performance on a specific task. **RAG** is a process of combining multiple models to enhance performance.
